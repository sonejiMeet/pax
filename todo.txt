What should work?
- Comments ( //, /**/ )
- assignement operator for different types (both un/initialised (if time allows))
- types integer, float, string, bool, (including different sizes of types)
- struct (c style)
- array using ( [] ) operators

Check things for correctness and proof of concept
- should obey operator precedence (pemdas eg.)
- some simple programs like computing factorial, estimating arctan with taylor series or something (this could be hard)
-


things to implement
- code manager for error checking and outputing
- mylang to cpp converter



My philosophy when writing compiler

use inline functions to reduce overhead of control transfer (places a copy of function's code at each point where it is called at compile time)

no classes or modern c++ junk
